This R notebook applies machine learning classification methods in the context of organizational network analysis. The goal was to test the predictive accuracy of various supervised learning models on company employee network data.

Specifically, measures like one's overall connectivity in the organization (eigenvector) and one's informational brokerage capacity (constraint) were fed into the machine learning models to examine the potential impact of classification techniques in the area of network analysis.
